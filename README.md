Description:

IRC Bot that hosts Mafia games (also known as werewolf)
This simple bot can currently host a vanilla only version of the party game Mafia. It is in very early development.

=======

Note: Current Issues

The main class has been partially rewritten, so there's that! :)

=======


Current Tasklist:

- Rewrite the Main class to be less awful
- Move the initialization variablers to a configuration file

Longer Term:

- Add roles (cop, doctor, etc)
- Add a database for stats
- Allow the Bot to run it's own channel (+m and manage channel chat)
- Handle errors better, make sure the bot doesn't crash
